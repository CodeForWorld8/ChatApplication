# ChatApplication

## About
As similar to Whatsapp or Messenger, in this Web Application, we can create a chat room to chat with one or more user by joining their individual chat room.
You also got a notification when you receive a message in a chat room.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if we make edits.<br>
We will also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Our app is ready to be deployed!
